	<td>Florida street racer Tej (Ludacris) is looking for a driver and calls Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) to a race. Brian is an ex-cop who has the hottest car now. He races against Suki (Devon Aoki), Orange Julius (Amaury Nolasco) and Slap Jack (Michael Ealy) and wins. The police arrive and give chase, capturing Brian. Agent Markham (James Remar) and Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) brief Brian and ask him to infiltrate a criminal's gang. They try to team him with Agent Dunn (Edward Finlay), but he's not very smart. Brian suggests bringing in an old friend by the name of Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) instead. <br><br><br> </td>

	<td>John Singleton's "2 Fast 2 Furious" tells a story so shamelessly preposterous all we can do is shake our heads in disbelief. Consider that the big climax involves a Miami druglord who hires two street racers to pick up bags full of money in North Beach and deliver them in the Keys, and adds, "You make it, I'll personally hand you $100 Gs at the finish line." Hell, for 10 Gs, I'd rent a van at the Aventura Mall and deliver the goods myself.</td>

	<td>In rural Arizona, a young, 17-year-old, redneck outcast named Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) starts his first day of school. As he is leaving school after classes, a fellow female student, named Cindy (Nikki Griffin) compliments him on his car. The girl's football player boyfriend, Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan), is jealous that she's talking with another person, and confronts Sean, insulting his car. Clay proceeds to brag about his Viper, while Sean insults him for using basic information you can read in a brochure. <br><br><br> </td>

	<td>This third outing made me almost nostalgic for the original movie starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Almost. The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift is another dismal chapter in a franchise that started promisingly enough with Rob Cohen's rebel-with-too-much-horse-power-but-lots-of-chicks.</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
	<td>Los Bandoleros (transl. The Outlaws) is a 2009 American direct-to-video short film written and directed by Vin Diesel. It is the second short film in the Fast & Furious franchise and serves as the prequel to Fast & Furious (2009). It stars Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Sung Kang, Tego Calderón, and Don Omar. In the film, runaway fugitive Dominic Toretto (Diesel) sets up the hijacking of a fuel tanker in the Dominican Republic.</td>
	<td>Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto
        Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz
        Sung Kang as Han Lue</td>
	<td>The Fast and Furious franchise can, at times, be confusing. The first movie, The Fast and the Furious, centers around Dominic Toretto and his family of fast-driving, big-hearted criminals. 2 Fast 2 Furious puts Dom completely out of the picture and follows good-cop-gone-bad-gone-good-again Brian O’Conner down to Miami, where he meets up with an old friend and has absolutely no interaction with anyone from the first film — except for one of his cop bosses. </td>
